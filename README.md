**Welcome to the Klaviyo Developers Slack!**

First, thank you for your interest in building with us. We greatly appreciate your participation in our community.

This README exists to help make this experience better for everyone, so please read it and adhere to the guidelines contained herein.

**Guidelines:**



* Never post private-keys/secrets
* Be kind and assume the best of everyone else
* Search public resources for help first - before asking a question in slack, you should search the content available in our developer portal and public developer community
* If you think you know the answer to a question, do not hesitate to help - developers often use “rubber duck debugging” to help reason out solutions, having someone attempt to help you can be incredibly useful even if their solution ends up not being exactly correct
* Use threads whenever possible - try to keep discussion organized by utilizing threads in slack to contain discussion and details for relevant topics
* Always post stack traces/error messages/etc in a thread - use the main post to discuss high level details and use threads to provide technical specifics, short code samples in top level posts are fine, but anything longer than a few lines should be threaded
* Do not use this slack for self or company promotion, including for Klaviyo. For example, if someone asks about integrating with a technology that is considered a competitor to Klaviyo, it is inappropriate to respond telling them they should use Klaviyo instead, same for other technology
* This account is part of Klaviyo’s Enterprise Slack account, all posts are accessible and logged in accordance with our company policies, assume everything you write is accessible by Klaviyo and Klaviyo admins

**Channel Strategy**

To start, we have created several channels and will detail below their goals and expected usage. If you want to post about something that does not fit neatly into an existing channel, please use #general-developer-chat.

**#api-help**

If you are using Klaviyo’s APIs (or attempting to) and need help troubleshooting, this is the place to ask questions. Please try to make your questions as specific as possible and include a clear statement as to what is currently the challenge/ what you are stuck on. 

Example post in this channel:

“Hey I’m currently using V2 People Search ([https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v2/people/search](https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v2/people/search)) and I am not getting a successful response when supplying an email address and valid private-key for a profile that I know exists, will thread the error response”

**#channel-suggestions**

Suggest a topic that you think is popular enough to warrant its own channel.

**#feedback-and-suggestions**

Do you have feedback for making the Klaviyo developer experience better? Improving the Klaviyo product? Something else you think would help us be better? We want to hear it from you.

**#general-developers-chat**

This is both our catch-all channel for topics that don’t neatly fit into another place, and also for general discussion about the work we do. If you want to share the thing you are currently working on, something you did in the past, something generally interesting and topical, this is the channel for less restrictive discussion.

**#general-help**

If you are running into an issue that is not specific to an API or related to the process of integrating a system with Klaviyo, this is the place to ask for help. Depending on the frequency of certain topics, we may create additional channels based on the types of questions that get asked here.

**#integration-help**

If you are trying to integrate with Klaviyo, either to get data into Klaviyo, get data out of Klaviyo, or some combination, this is the channel to discuss how to do that.

**#introduce-yourself**

Use this channel to introduce yourself/your company to the Klaviyo Developer Slack community. This is the place to do a little self promotion and tell us about all of the interesting things you work on. It is very helpful to have an introduction post so that as you communicate with other members of the community, people can search for this post and understand your background and experience (especially useful when helping debug an issue together)

**#product-launches**

When Klaviyo has a new product or feature launch, we will post about it and discuss it in this channel

**#random**

This channel is for random articles/discussions. Please avoid anything that could be viewed as controversial, we are fostering an inclusive and welcoming community, this is not the place to argue (you can use the rest of the internet for that).
